# Coordination Board — China3 (money-out-of-China research)

Branch: `arena/f43e42c8-china3` (current session); main also contains prior session work merged via PR #1.
Remote: https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/China3.git
Session ID conventions: `<owner>-<task-id>`, e.g. `arena-f43e42c8-china3-T1`.

## Sessions involved

- `arena/dd766f7b-china3` (prior session, work already merged to main via PR #1): repository review, official-source research, executive brief dashboard (`index.html`, `routes.html`, `tax.html`, `review.html`, `sources.html`, `assets/site.css`), verification log, findings/irregularities, GitHub Pages workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`).
- `arena-f43e42c8-china3` (current session): CNY→USD conversion-methods research (`research/cny-usd-conversion-research.md`), executive summary (`docs/executive-summary.md`), dashboard subpages (`methods.html`, `china-rules.html`, `us-tax.html`, `penalties.html`, `flagged-review.html`, `style.css`), unified landing page integration, PR #2 and merge to main, GitHub Pages deployment verification.

## Legend
- Status: `unclaimed` | `in progress` | `done` | `needs review`
- `needs review` = item is published on the Flagged for Review page and does not block anything.
- Before starting a task: claim it here (write session ID + file scope), commit and push immediately.
- Never start a task another session has claimed. If a claim is >60 min old with no commits, any session may take over (note the handoff in the log).
- Make small, frequent commits; run `git pull --rebase` before every push.
- If a task requires changing a file owned by another session, log the request here instead of editing it.
- Shared outputs (table data, index, navigation) are changed only by the final integration session once all other tasks are done.

## Log

- 2026-11-07: Prior session `arena/dd766f7b-china3` completed repository review, research, dashboard, verification log, and Pages workflow; merged to main as PR #1.
- 2026-11-07: Current session `arena-f43e42c8-china3` branched from `03021bc` (old main); completed T1–T5 on branch `arena/f43e42c8-china3`.
- 2026-11-07: Merge conflict between current branch and main (README.md auto-merged; COORDINATION.md and index.html resolved by unification). Both sessions' work preserved: prior session's `routes.html`, `tax.html`, `review.html`, `sources.html`, `assets/site.css` retained; current session's `methods.html`, `china-rules.html`, `us-tax.html`, `penalties.html`, `flagged-review.html`, `style.css`, `research/`, `docs/` added. Unified `index.html` links to all pages.
- Pending: PR #2 merge to main, then verify GitHub Pages deploys successfully, then record PR link and merge result here.

## Verification log (prior session, preserved)

- Initial repository review: only an 8-byte README existed; no application, data, coordination board, tests, or deployment config was present.
- Source review: opened the official SAFE 2022 annual convenience-amount FAQ; SAFE 2024 outward remittance FAQ; SAFE 2009 anti-splitting circular; SAFE 2015 press-conference transcript; PBOC individual FX rules and personal-property transfer rules; PBOC RMB FDI rules and CIPS rules; IRS FBAR guidance, Form 8938 threshold page, Publication 54 and Publication 514.
- Each substantive row in the routes, tax/reporting, flagged-review and source-register tables has one or more direct official source links. Every unconfirmed individual amount, bank rate, fee, tax calculation, eligibility conclusion or account fact is explicitly blank/unverified and included on Flagged for Review.
- Local audit script checked all page-to-page links and confirmed no missing local targets. A row-audit confirmed every data row in routes.html, tax.html, review.html and sources.html contains an `https://` source URL.
- HTTP smoke test passed for all five pages using a local static server.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## Findings and irregularities (prior session, preserved)

- The phrase “considerable amount of taxes” was user-reported without a tax assessment, bank quote, tax receipt, named tax or amount. It is not treated as verified.
- Official SAFE guidance distinguishes the USD 50,000 annual individual FX convenience amount from an absolute quota and from tax; authentic eligible current-account transactions can require evidence above the convenience amount. It does not establish generic permission to export any personal capital/savings balance.
- SAFE expressly prohibits quota splitting via multiple people/relatives. Informal brokers, third-party quota use, false-purpose invoices and cash/crypto schemes are not recommended.
- Exact bank exchange spread, wire/correspondent/receiving fees and personal Chinese/U.S. tax remain unverified because no bank, amount, account documents, source-of-funds history or tax filings were supplied.
- Some Chinese administrative FAQs are local-branch publications and some English regulatory material is an official but expressly unofficial translation. Current local branch/bank practice must be confirmed before action.
- Reporting thresholds and tax obligations are fact- and tax-year-dependent; this is general research, not advice.
